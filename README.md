Supplementary material for the article "Scalable nanocomposite parylene-based memristors: multifilamentary resistive switching and neuromorphic applications" by Anna N. Matsukatova, Artyom Yu. Vdovichenko, Timofey D. Patsaev, Pavel A. Forsh, Pavel K. Kashkarov, Vyacheslav A. Demin, and Andrey V. Emelyanov.

This repository contains a toy example of the experimental memristive data (memristor conductance change as the voltage pulses are applied to the structure). The code demonstrates how the memristor conductance can be used as the weights of a formal neural network. The detailed description of the used heart disease dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease.
